Kurento Utils for Node.js and browsers
=============
Utilities for Kurento Web SDK

The Kurento Utils project contains a set of reusable components that have been
found useful during the development of the Kurento Web SDK, and the different 
projects that serve as demo.

The source code of this project can be cloned from the [GitHub repository].

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Be sure to have installed the Node.js tools in your system. It's heavily
encouraged to use the latest Node.js and NPM versions from the
[Node.js project PPA] instead of the packages available on the oficial Ubuntu
repositories, since due to the fast-moving Node.js community and environment
these last ones get easily outdated and can lead to incompatibility errors:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -

sudo apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy
```

To install the library, it's recomended to do that from the [NPM repository] :

```bash
npm install kurento-utils
```

Alternatively, you can download the code using git and install manually its
dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-utils
cd kurento-utils
npm install
```

### Browser

To build the browser version of the library you'll only need to exec the [grunt]
task runner and they will be generated on the ```dist``` folder. Alternatively,
if you don't have it globally installed, you can run a local copy by executing

```bash
node_modules/.bin/grunt
```
